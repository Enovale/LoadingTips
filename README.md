A Lethal Company mod that adds randomized loading tips to the darkened loading screen before a moon loads.

This mod's concept is entirely based on [AutoMessage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/hoffr/AutoMessage/) by [hoffr](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/hoffr/).
I really just did not like the implementation of the concept and the limitations it has, so I wanted to try it myself.
